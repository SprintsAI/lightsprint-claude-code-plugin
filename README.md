# Lightsprint Claude Code Plugin

Claude Code plugin for Lightsprint — task management skills and workspace board integration.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** CLI installed
- **Node.js >= 18** (for built-in `fetch`)
- A **Lightsprint workspace** at [lightsprint.ai](https://lightsprint.ai)

## Quick Start

Install the plugin (one time):

```bash
npx lightsprint
```

Then use any `/lightsprint:` command — the plugin opens your browser to connect on first use:

```
/lightsprint:tasks
```

That's it. The first command auto-prompts for authorization and connects you to a Lightsprint workspace.

---

## Installation

### npx (recommended)

```bash
npx lightsprint
```

### Curl fallback

If you don't have npm/npx available, you can install via curl:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SprintsAI/lightsprint-claude-code-plugin/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Non-interactive install

If you're installing from a non-interactive environment (e.g., Claude Code, CI, or a script):

```bash
npx -y lightsprint
```

Or with curl:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SprintsAI/lightsprint-claude-code-plugin/main/install.sh)" <<< $'Y\nY'
```

The plugin will be installed but the workspace connection step will be skipped. You can connect later by running `/lightsprint:tasks`, which prompts you to authorize and pick a workspace.

---

## Authentication

Authentication is **on-demand** — the first time you use a `/lightsprint:` command without an active connection, the plugin opens your browser to authorize. You pick a Lightsprint workspace, and tokens are saved locally. Tokens refresh automatically.

The active workspace is stored in a single connection file (`~/.lightsprint/connection.json`). All commands (`tasks`, `projects`, `stacks`, `create`, etc.) operate against that connected workspace. Hooks silently skip if no connection exists (they never prompt).

### Switching workspaces

Run `lightsprint connect` again to authorize and switch to a different workspace, or `lightsprint disconnect` to clear the active connection. Use `lightsprint status` / `lightsprint whoami` to see which workspace is currently connected.

### Repository detection

Connecting needs a GitHub repository. The plugin inspects **every** remote in the working tree — not just `origin` — and understands every URL form git accepts (`https://`, `ssh://` with or without a port, `git://`, `git+ssh://`, scp-style `git@host:owner/repo.git`, embedded credentials, trailing `.git` or `/`, and repo names containing dots). SSH host aliases from `~/.ssh/config` (e.g. `git@github-work:owner/repo.git`) are resolved via `ssh -G`.

When several remotes could match, the first of these wins:

1. the remote your current branch tracks
2. `origin`
3. `upstream`
4. the only GitHub remote, if there is exactly one

Anything else resolves deterministically and tells you which remote it picked. If your branch tracks a remote other than `origin`, the plugin says which repo it chose and how to change it — the answer would otherwise shift when you switch branches. Remotes that are not GitHub (GitLab, Bitbucket, local paths) are skipped and listed in the error message if none match.

Conventional GitHub Enterprise hosts such as `github.acme.com` and
`github.internal` are recognized automatically. If your Enterprise installation
uses another hostname, opt it in explicitly:

```bash
export LIGHTSPRINT_GITHUB_HOSTS=github.acme.com,code.acme.internal
```

Note that Lightsprint links repos by `owner/repo` name alone, so an enterprise repo connects against the workspace repo of the same name.

To see what the plugin detects for the current folder:

```bash
node ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/lightsprint/scripts/detect-repo.js --explain
```

### Optional: Custom base URL

For self-hosted Lightsprint instances:

```bash
export LIGHTSPRINT_BASE_URL=https://your-instance.example.com
```

Defaults to `https://app.lightsprint.ai`.

## How It Works

### Skills (slash commands)

All skills operate on the connected workspace.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/lightsprint:tasks` | List tasks from the workspace board. Options: `--status backlog\|todo\|in_progress\|in_review\|done`, `--stack <ref>`, `--limit N` |
| `/lightsprint:projects` | List projects in the workspace |
| `/lightsprint:create <title>` | Create a new task. Options: `--description <text>`, `--complexity low\|medium\|high`, `--status backlog\|todo\|in_progress\|in_review\|done`, `--stack <ref>` |
| `/lightsprint:update <id>` | Update a task. Options: `--title <text>`, `--description <text>`, `--status <status>`, `--complexity <level>`, `--assignee <name>` |
| `/lightsprint:get <id>` | Get full details of a task — title, status, description, todo list, related files, complexity |
| `/lightsprint:claim <id>` | Claim a task — sets it to in_progress and shows full details |
| `/lightsprint:comment <id> <text>` | Add a comment to a task |

Stacks group tasks within a workspace. List them with `lightsprint stacks`, inspect one with `lightsprint stacks get <stackId|prefix|name>`, and target a stack on `tasks`/`create` via `--stack <ref>`.

### Claiming tasks

When you use `/lightsprint:claim`, the plugin:
1. Sets the Lightsprint task to `in_progress`
2. Creates a Claude Code task linked via `metadata: { lightsprint_task_id: "<LS task ID>" }`
3. Subsequent `TaskUpdate` calls on the Claude Code task automatically sync to the correct Lightsprint task

```

Zero npm dependencies — uses Node.js built-in `fetch`, `crypto`, and `fs`.

### Local files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.lightsprint/connection.json` | Active workspace connection — OAuth tokens (access + refresh + expiry) and workspace ID/name |
| `~/.lightsprint/active-task.json` | Currently in-progress task |

---

## Uninstalling

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SprintsAI/lightsprint-claude-code-plugin/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

This removes the plugin from Claude Code and clears the active workspace connection in `~/.lightsprint/connection.json`.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Token expired / refresh failed

Use any `/lightsprint:` command — the plugin will re-prompt for authorization if the refresh token has expired.

### Hook not firing

Verify the plugin is loaded:

```bash
claude --debug
```

Check that `hooks/hooks.json` is being picked up and `PostToolUse` matchers are registered.
